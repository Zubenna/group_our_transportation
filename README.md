## Group Our Transportation App (Rails Capstone Project)

This project entails building a mobile application where a user or group logs all the distances covered in Kilometer(KM) within a particular period for various means of transportations. Each means of transportation is set up as a group that will contain a record of movement made within such a group. Users can also create records for each particular means of transportation used. This includes recording in particular, the distance covered by that movement in KM, the date and time of movement, the creator of the record, and the current total distance in KM displayed at the top right corner of the app page. Users must create an account and log in before creating records. This project employed the implementation of rails MVC architecture, utilizing the model, controller, view, routes, associations, partials, and styling knowledge in building a rails app.
