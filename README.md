## Group Our Transportation App (Rails Capstone Project)

This project entails building an online appllication where a user or group logs all the distances covered in Kilometer(KM) within a particular period for various means of transportations. Each means of transportation is set up as a group that will contain record of movements made within such group. User can also create records for each particular means of transportation used. This include recording in particular, the distance covered by in that movement in KM, the date and time of movement, the creator of the record and the current total of distance in KM displayed at the top right corner of the app page. User must create account and log in before creating records. This project employed the implementation of rails MVC architecture, utilising model, controller, view, routes, associations, partials and styling knowledge in building a rails app.
